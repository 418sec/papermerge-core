What is Papermerge?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Papermerge is an open source document management system (DMS) primarily
designed for archiving and retrieving your digital documents. Instead of
having piles of paper documents all over your desk, office or drawers - you
can quickly scan them and configure your scanner to directly upload to
Papermerge DMS.

Papermerge DMS on its turn will
`OCR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition>`_ the
document and index it. You will be able to quickly find any (scanned!)
document using full text search capabilities.
